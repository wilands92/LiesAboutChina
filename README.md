# Lies About China
One-stop site for understanding how the media lies about China. (work in progress)

## Introduction

This repo aims to be a one-stop site for people to start understand how lies are made about China. 

We provide some of our own independent research, but also rely heavily on analysis made by other people all over the world. 

In the name of freedom and democracy, and under the full support of the great peace-loving, beacon of humanity ███, 30 children are ██ every ██ in the last ██ ██. ██ journalists ██, outperforming ██ ██ in WW2 by 3x where only 67 journalists ██ in total. But we are told that everything is good. And although China has [no vvars in more than 40 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlh9rwlYM14), China has to be the only evil thing in the world. [$1.6 billion](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/china-cold-war-2669160202/) is needed to pay people to create news about China. And [trillions](https://www.usaspending.gov/agency/department-of-defense?fy=2025) are needed for [constant military interventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_interventions_by_the_United_States) around the world. But it's totally OK, American people are in a [great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9qJVR-TDd4) spot, and simply won't benefit from better infra or healthcare, right? 

In the last 2 years, due to a number of factors, more and more people around the world start to realize their perception of China, and the world in general, has been heavily manipulated by the media. This repo strives to collect information that will help you break out of the information cacoon faster, and develop the ability to think critically and validate data independently. 

Note that the goal here is not to make you think China is perfect. China is still a developing country with many social problems. And there are good things about the west. The goal here is to help you see things in a more comprehensive way. (But of course anyone who dares say anything slightly good about China, even if it is true, will immediately be called a CPC bot lol.)

## Part 1: The First Step Towards Critical Thinking

The first question you need to ask yourself is, do you think the mainstream media tells you 100% truth, 100% of the time about China? Are you even allowed to think that they may tell you a bit of incorrect information, even for maybe just 1% of their reports? If they asked an intern who has never been to China to make a report about China, is it even possible for this intern to not able to present 100% the truth? 

If you 100% believe in the mainstream media, take a look at examples below:

- How BBC edits a video from Chinese media to twist the message 
  - Look at ["New evidence of China moving Uighur minority workers in order to uproot communities - BBC News"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mqga0a6H8I&t=92s) see the video clip of girl crying at 1:32. Notice how BBC did not translate the Chinese words. 
  - BBC clipped this from 4:35 in [“Assignment Asia Episode 75: Transforming lives and building bridges in xj”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07NjqkQAgs8&t=285s) (Nov 5, 2017). 
  - The Chinese guy here said "just give it a try, doesn't matter how many days, if you don't like it, you immediately go back, what about that? They will buy you roundtrip tickets". BBC completely removed English subtitles so that a English speaker cannot understand what he said and will think he is threatening the girl. The other 25 minutes of the video, including discussion of why the family don't want the girl to leave and why the girl is hesitating, and how the guy was trying to figure out whether he did sth wrong after seeing the girl crying are also conveniently removed so you won't see them.
  - This lie is initially exposed in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm5fNV0rSaI&t=520s)
  - The point is not that Chinese state media always tells the truth. It is also not that there were no racial tension or violent racial incidents in China, there were. The point is you are not allowed to know what they said and the other context in the original video, you are not allowed to see the full picture. 
  - Now, do you still think the media tells you the truth 100% of the time? 

Here is another example, ask yourself, since the mainstream media says China has a genocide in XinJiang, and the US is famous for its [unconditional love for muslims](https://www.stopwar.org.uk/article/why-has-the-us-invaded-occupied-or-bombed-14-muslim-countries-in-30-years/). Then the Uyghur muslim population in China must have dropped significantly in the last few decades, right? At the same time, since the US has so much love for human rights, native americans must have been living a fantastic life, right? 

- Comparing Xinjiang Uyghur population change to Native Americans
  - Check out China population breakdown table here in [List of ethnic groups in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_China)
  - From the table, you can see the Han people population in 1990 is 1,042,482,187. In 2020, it is 1,284,446,389. 
  - Put these numbers in a calculator, you will find the growth rate is 0.23210391987.
  - From the table, you can see the Uyghur people population in 1990 is 7,214,431. In 2020, it is 11,774,538.
  - Put these numbers in a calculator, you will find the growth rate is 0.63208131036.
  - Put the growth rates in the calculator you will see the Uyghur population growth is 2.72326857174 times faster compared to the Han population. 
  - So China is wiping them out, by allowing their population to grow at 2.72x rate compared to the ethnic majority Han people, pretty effective genocide, huh? 
  - Now what about Native Americans? Before European colonization, it is estimated to be [50 million people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_history_of_the_Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas). 
  - Look at [US 2020 census data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States), Alone or in combination, the number is 9,666,058, 2.92% of total US population. 
  - 9,666,058 / 50,000,000 = 0.19332116. Their population reduced by more than 80%, and never recovered to its original level. 
  - The faster ethnic minority growth is because they are excluded from [one-child policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy).
  - Additionally, you can find other interesting things about Xinajiang, search on Google for Chinese rmb, you will find the Uyghur text on it. 
  - ![rmb](https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/db/ce/50/dbce50d52b2164a2cf9d18b0a7ff9b17.jpg)
  - Putting ethnic minority text on your currency so everyone has to see them everyday... very useful for wiping out a people, huh? 
  - They also get [bonus score on exams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_China), making them easier to enter top China universities, (there are reports of Han students pretending to be ethnic minority to get bonus score lol) often with a tuition of [<2K dollars per year](https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-college-education-cost-in-China-How-do-students-pay-for-it?no_redirect=1). In the US it can be [\$60K](https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/tuition-and-fees) for a year in Harvard. 
  - To be scientific, population growth does not prove there is no genocide. The point is you should think about whether these numbers are 100% aligned with what the media has told you? Or are you even allowed to think it is only 99% aligned? 


## Part 2 Major Lies About China By Topics
If you now 99% believe in the media, then you can go check out other topics. If you are still 100%, well, feel free to just close this page and believe China is source of all evil for the rest of your life. 

### China in Africa
- "Chinese investment in Africa is a dept trap"
  - **Context:** For over 400 years, more than [15 million](https://www.un.org/en/observances/decade-people-african-descent/slave-trade) men, women and children were the victims of the tragic transatlantic slave trade by the west, one of the darkest chapters in human history. China never invaded Africa.
  - [The Myth of the Chinese Debt Trap in Africa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-QDEWwSkP0) Bloomberg Originals in-depth analysis, Mar 17, 2022. 
  - [When the West visits Africa, they talk about China.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw2BOG57_2M&) Two African men talk about the west and China in Africa, Oct 9, 2022
  - [U.S Reporter Hates China in Africa Gets Schooled about the West's Brutal Tactics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl3wQTVTPVo) Former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis explains the issue, May 2, 2023.
  - [China's MEGAPROJECTS Are Changing Africa's Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiLIksoZ6rI) Sep 28, 2024
  - [Why China is Building Africa’s Railways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z4iVqd-Tkk) Oct 20, 2021

### China is the most aggressive country in the world
- China has no wars in more than 40 years. But it is true that China has been spraying water on Filipino ships. And of course that is much much worse than e.g. killing [200,000 Filipino civilians](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/war), or killing [1 million people in Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War), or [dropping two million tons of bombs in Laos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7CpkWFfxkk), or supporting the most ███ ███ ███ in human history. 

### Chinese cities, daily lives

- "China cities are all AI made, Chinese high speed rail is fake, China has no internet or electricity"
  - [IShowSpeed live in China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpX04R596o4) (Very rich and famous young American doing live in multiple cities in China)
  - [Guanzhang live in China mainland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfGt8KeM_Jw) (Famous Taiwanese guy visiting mainland for the first time)

- "Chinese people cannot afford anything"
  - **Context:** Chinese average monthly salary is [\$1392 in 2024](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/monthly-earnings), while the US average salary is [\$5000](https://www.consumershield.com/articles/average-salary-per-month), for both there are some other sources with different numbers, the highest for US is [$6911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage). Let's use 6911 for the US, so then it is about 5x of the Chinese average salary. 
  - What the media often does not mention is that the cost for everything in China is often [much lower than](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=China&country2=United+States) in the US. Additionally, China has no tipping culture, and you don't pay a tax when buying most of the things, you also don't pay property tax for the house you bought. A top Chinese university has a tuition of [<2K dollars per year](https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-college-education-cost-in-China-How-do-students-pay-for-it?no_redirect=1) (more expensive for international students, [\$5-6k](https://studyinchinas.com/university/peking-university/)). In the US it can be [\$60K](https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/tuition-and-fees) for a year in Harvard. Because it is not straightforward to understand these differences, some Chinese think US people 100% live in Heaven and some US people think Chinese 100% live in hell. 
  - [I Left The U.S. For China — Here's How Much It Costs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9v2wBwDXls) An American girl in China explains living cost in China. Jul 3, 2025.
  - [Chinese People on RedNote are STUNNED by Americans’ Healthcare Costs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTQcaj9tQ40) Chinese people literally thought the 1000$ ambulance in the US is CPC propaganda lol. 

### China will collapse in the next 10 minutes
- [Hakim's discussion on the China collapse narrative and other things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vusLJShNIfE)
- [China's Mega "Ghost" Cities are INSANE | Hasanabi reacts to WSJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFrCcWzTTmg)


### Xizang (Tibet)

- "Tibet was a perfect, flawless utopia before PLA went there to liberate it"
  - (Disturbing image warning)
  - [Here](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-de13586e0d86ce3f2e73ab99482a077c-lq) is an image of human skin at religious ceremonies in old Tibet, that is how common people in Tibet was treated before PLA went there, looks very utopia, huh? 
  - [Here](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cbde3b7dde1003687745adc3a73ea458-lq) is an image of chopped off arms of slaves in old Tibet. Another image of [poor slaves in old Tibet](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7c1dcd94538352bb8f7d130c51699932)
  - Read more on this [quora thread](https://www.quora.com/The-Chinese-Communist-Party-often-claims-that-Tibet-before-1959-was-a-dark-theocratic-feudal-serfdom-with-cruel-punishments-but-Tibetans-abroad-often-deny-these-claims-So-what-was-the-real-situation-in-old-Tibet)
  - [Tibet - The Truth Official Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sko0oEKoHk)
  - Decide for yourself how utopia this place was before PLA liberates them, and whether you, as a person who surely loves human rights and freedom, want these common people to go back to their previous living conditions. 
  - In case you don't know, Americans went to [war because of slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) as well, causing [750,000 deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/science/civil-war-toll-up-by-20-percent-in-new-estimate.html), US and China also [worked together](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/liberation-china-and-pacific) at the later stage of WW2. 

## Part 3 other lies and information manipulation about China
Will try to do quick updates here whenever new info emerges. 
- Apr 29, 2025, China released a video discussing why a country should not kneel to a bully in a trade war. there are 2min 19 seconds in the [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGRx69vhCzI). However, some media such as 
Sky News Australia decided to clip major parts of the video in their [report]
 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgkVPShQPg&t=2s) into only 31 seconds, also conveniently removed the parts where it is explained how US crushed Japanese companies and hurt Japanese economy, and how US destroyed France's industrial giant Alstom, making sure its American audience will not have easy access to that information. 
- Mar 20, 2025, some western medias reported that [China says acted 'in accordance with the law' after 4 Canadians executed • FRANCE 24 English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02ajpqdrDSs), in the title, very conveniently left out the fact they have smuggled 200 kg of drugs. And it's not like China has [suffered massively from drugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1dbOf63roI) right? And certainly Canada has no drug problem [for sure](https://www.cpha.ca/toxic-drugs).


## Why I made this repo
I used to dislike the CPC, and even though I have been to China and know Mandarin, when BBC uploaded the report on Xinjiang a few years ago, I believed it. Because I watched BBC and BBC Earth since I was a kid, and I had a lot of love and respect for BBC. That is, until I did my independent research and found out exactly how they lied to me. 

Also, the ███ ███ is a wake-up call for many of us. 

This repo is partly to help myself... so next time I talk with a brainwashed friend I can just send this repo to them. But if this is useful to you, please consider star it or even help me add more content as a collaborator. Thank you! 

## Final notes
Still trying to figure out how to better organize things. And will try to add Chinese text and sources as well. This repo is not funded by anyone so update will be slow, but hopefully we can keep making it more comprehensive in the years to come. (Very certain in the next 100 years more lies will emerge)
